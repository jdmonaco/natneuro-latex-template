\paragraph{Subjects.} 
Adult male wombles were \lipsum[8-9]

\paragraph{Place fields.}
The spatial information content\cite{SkagMcNa93a} of spiking activity was computed as
\begin{equation}
  I=\sum_{i=1}^{N} \; p_i \; \frac{r_i}{R} \; \log_2\left(\frac{r_i}{R}\right)
  \label{eq:skaggs}
\end{equation}
where $p_i$ is the occupancy probability and $r_i$ is the average firing rate of the $i$th bin, and $R$ is the average firing rate for the session.
